# Preferred assignment
- Backend/Laravel


## Setting it all up:
- While doing lots of research about most of the things written inside 
Well setting it all up wasn't the easiest thing in the world. Mostly because of a lack of experience in SQLite, where I tried to work without downloading a single piece of software. But after barely any sleep and lots and lots of StackOverflow I came to a great distance.


## What have I learned:
I've learned a lot during this assessment. I learned about using SQLite which I had never even worked with before. 
I learned that not everything could be fixed within a really short period of 24 hours. But I have learned to accept the fact of not being able to finish it.
Teaching myself to download more software for projects was a new thing for me but I am glad that I made that choice.


## What could I improve:
I could not improve on anything without receiving some feedback on what I could do better or easier.
I am glad to have the opportunity to work on such an outstanding assessment. 
Wishing for more time was something I knew that is was going to happen. 


## Techniques I used:
Visual Studio Code.
GitHub.
SQLite.
Youtube, Discord, Stackoverflow, and Google (for research).


## Last few words:
I have never done anything at the degree of this difficulty and I, therefore, hope that I could receive some feedback and hopefully see you all at my internship.

Thank you for making this possible.

Sincerely,
Sam
